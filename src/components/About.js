      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Victor Castellon and I was born and raised in Orlando Florida
        for a majority of my life with the rest of the small period being in Jalisco, Mexico.
        Throughout my time, I have grown many passions on hobbies such as: Cooking, Computers, Music, and Gaming.
        There has been great history with every single one I have listed, however, it has been decided 
        that it would be great to study more into Computers and find a profession that
        can not only be a profound career to begin, but also be amusing and enjoyable.
        </p> 
        <p>I am always intrigued with learning new things and when it comes to computers, 
          it never failed to amaze me. Building my PC had started my passion and have later on went more
          into helping family and friends with assembling a new computer or even repairing old parts for them.
          My knowledge on computer hardware is if not great then acceptable when it comes to the basics, but
          I did not want to stop there and looked into Computer Software, where I am currently working for
          my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and have completed a fullstack web development course.
          Although I have grew very fond for Front End development compared to Back End in the course and would
          prefer to be in the Front End, there is still so much growth in learning both branches that I hope
          to land an even greater role for a company.
